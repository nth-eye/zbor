# utl

Header-only utility library (`utl::` stands for __UTiL__) with small, simple and common functions and containers, which nevertheless weren't present in C++20 (was C++17 before, so some functions are now just wrappers for `std::`) standard library. All functions that can be `constexpr` are. Not intended to become anything serious, but you may find some parts really useful, for example `"float.h"` has IEE 754 half-precision floating point conversion functions. I use this library in many projects for embedded systems and in my other libraries, e.g. [zbor][1].
